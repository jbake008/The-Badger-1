Weekly plans

9/26
Status: Unknown error encountered in PC version. Visual studio shows no syntax errors, and yet, no matter what is changed, an error preventing the latest
build from being loaded occurs. Previous build working fine, but progress is halted until this error can be worked around or fixed.
Interface basics, complete.
Button 1 form 1, Functioning and complete (this button is too open form 2, which contains the 8ball mode of The Badger)
Form2(8ball mode) Title added, text box with instructions added, typeable text box added, background image added.
Weekly Goal:
PC version: Troubleshoot source of error, and build a workaround or fix the error source.
